separate plugins into Service and Plugin
    I don't know exactly how or what distinguishes them

make a usable non-volitile memory for superbot

Be sure to include the following in some way:
    def getTarget(bot,userline,msg):
        if msg[0]==bot.nick:
            return userline.split("!")[0]
        return msg[0]
    perhaps do this inside superbot so the plugins don't have to call it

    hasService(serviceName)

Plugin Tester:
    creates a console interface that allows you to send messages to a plugin
    to see what they would output
